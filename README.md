# movie_recommendation_system
The project aims to build a content-based movie recommendation system which will suggest movies similar to a movie the user provides as input.

Description:
The Content-Based Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based project designed to suggest movies to users based on the attributes and features of the movies they have shown interest in. Unlike collaborative filtering, which relies on user preferences and behaviors, a content-based system uses the information embedded in the movies themselves, such as genre, director, actors, keywords, and other metadata. By analyzing the content features of movies that a user has liked or rated highly, the system identifies and recommends similar movies. This personalized approach aims to improve user experience by offering suggestions that match their tastes and preferences.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop an efficient content-based movie recommendation system that can predict and suggest movies to users based on their past preferences. The system will leverage movie metadata (such as genres, actors, and plot summaries) to calculate similarities and provide recommendations. Additionally, the project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the recommendation engine in terms of user satisfaction and recommendation accuracy. Through this, users will be able to discover new movies aligned with their viewing history and preferences.


How it Works:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Loads movie data from a CSV file (likely containing movie titles, genres, keywords, cast, director, etc.).
Cleans and prepares the data by handling missing values and combining relevant features (genres, keywords, tagline, cast, director) into a single text string for each movie.
Feature Extraction:

Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert the text data into numerical feature vectors. These vectors represent the importance of different words in each movie's description.
Similarity Calculation:

Calculates the cosine similarity between the feature vectors of all movies. This measures how similar movies are based on their descriptions.
Recommendation Generation:

Takes the user's movie input.
Finds the closest matching movie title in the dataset.
Retrieves the similarity scores of that movie with all other movies.
Sorts the movies based on similarity scores in descending order.
Recommends the top N most similar movies to the user.
Key Libraries Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
difflib: For finding close matches between movie titles.
scikit-learn (TfidfVectorizer, cosine_similarity): For feature extraction and similarity calculation.
In essence, the project creates a system that analyzes the descriptions of movies and recommends movies with similar characteristics to the user's input.
