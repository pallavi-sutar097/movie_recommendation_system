# movie_recommendation_system
Project Goal:

The project aims to build a content-based movie recommendation system which will suggest movies similar to a movie the user provides as input.

How it Works:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Loads movie data from a CSV file (likely containing movie titles, genres, keywords, cast, director, etc.).
Cleans and prepares the data by handling missing values and combining relevant features (genres, keywords, tagline, cast, director) into a single text string for each movie.
Feature Extraction:

Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert the text data into numerical feature vectors. These vectors represent the importance of different words in each movie's description.
Similarity Calculation:

Calculates the cosine similarity between the feature vectors of all movies. This measures how similar movies are based on their descriptions.
Recommendation Generation:

Takes the user's movie input.
Finds the closest matching movie title in the dataset.
Retrieves the similarity scores of that movie with all other movies.
Sorts the movies based on similarity scores in descending order.
Recommends the top N most similar movies to the user.
Key Libraries Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
difflib: For finding close matches between movie titles.
scikit-learn (TfidfVectorizer, cosine_similarity): For feature extraction and similarity calculation.
In essence, the project creates a system that analyzes the descriptions of movies and recommends movies with similar characteristics to the user's input.
